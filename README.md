# Exercise 21 - Using Fetch

For this exercise, you are going to finish the `fetch` call which will load a new joke onto the page.

The submit event handler is already wired up, and everytime the user hits submit the `submitHandler` function is called.

The `submitHandler` function prevents the default form action and then calls `fetch` and gets the response from API and then uses the helper functions to add the joke to the list.

More detailed instructions for what JS to add are in your your `javascript-start.js` file. You will not have to update the `HTML` or `CSS` for this exercise.

## Steps

Since you now experts at cloning repos, one option open to you is that you could clone this `Exercise-21` repo and then work on it locally.

If you aren't as comfortable with cloning just yet, you can copy the HTML, CSS and JS files in the main project folder to your local machine and modify the `javascript-start.css` file until you acheive the desired outcome. In this exercise you must not modify the main HTML file or CSS file to acheive the desired outcome.

Please note that you should not be editing the CSS reset file.
